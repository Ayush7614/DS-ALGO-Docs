# Insertion Sort

## Introduction 
----------
- Insertion Sort is an Sorting Algorithm like Bubble Sort. In best case scenario it take O(n) time and in worst case it takes O(n^2) time.

- In this approach the array is assumed to be divided into two parts one is sorted and another is not.

## Algorithm 
    1. Iterate over 1 to n-1 element.
    1. Compare every element with its previous element
    1. If the element is smaller than previous then compare it with element before and swap the smaller one with the larger one.

## Code

```
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void insertionSort(int arr[],int n){
    for(int i=0;i<n-1;i++){
        int j=i-1; //Previous element
        while(arr[j]>arr[i] && j>=0 ){
            arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
            j = j - 1;
        }
        arr[j+1]=arr[i];
    }

}


int main(){
    int arr[] = { 12, 11, 13, 5, 6 };
    int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);
 
    insertionSort(arr, n);
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
        cout<<arr[i]<<" ";
    }
    cout<<endl;
 
    return 0;
}

```
